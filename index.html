      <h2 class="volwhat1">What is Volunteering ?</h2><br>
      <h4 class="volwhat2">Volunteering is an act of selfless service where individuals contribute their time, skills, and resources towards making a positive impact in their communities or in society as a whole. It is a powerful tool for effecting change, promoting social justice, and building stronger, more connected communities.</h4><br>
      <p class="volwhat2">Volunteering can take many forms, from assisting with disaster relief efforts, to tutoring students, to working with animals, to providing support for those in need. It is an opportunity to give back and make a difference, while also gaining valuable experience, building new relationships, and developing a deeper sense of empathy and compassion. By volunteering, individuals can learn about themselves and their communities, develop new skills, and work towards a common goal of creating a better world for everyone. In a world that is increasingly disconnected and divided, volunteering is more important than ever, as it allows us to come together and work towards a shared vision of a better future.</p>

                <p class="p1p"> I appreciate the following during the volunteering. I felt like they take care of us. the experience in the association was
                    really nice too. It was easy to communicate with them
                    even though we didn't speak the same language. I
                    recommend it to people who want to know another
                    culture and language. Everything was so nice. The
                    experience with the family, it was amazing too. Esma's
                    family were very close to us, paying attention to our
                    comfort. we had fun with them. Thank you very much
                    for everything.</p>

                <p class="p1p"> I was sceptical at first and hesitated to commit. But
                    ended up signing up to go with my brother and to
                    fulfill my high school volunteer requirement. I am glad
                    I did! I loved it and found it a very inspiring and
                    uplifting experience. The youth teaching program is a
                    great learning and teaching opportunity. I enjoyed
                    working with the experienced staff and the children a
                    lot more than I thought I would. There is a lot to see
                    and do in Morocco. The places, the beaches, the
                    people are very welcoming and beautiful! I was able to
                    relax, make new friends and enjoy super delicious
                    Moroccan food.</p>

                    volunteer in morocco and honestly wish i'd could
                    spend longer here. The experience was so rewarding-
                    from living in the traditional moroccan streets in the
                    medina to being able to teach children and women
                    english and helping them improve their skills. The
                    people here are so unbelievably friendly that i felt right
                    at home from the start- i'm glad i chose morocco as
                    the place where i got to do my first volunteering</p>
